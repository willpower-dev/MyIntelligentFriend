The Artificial Intelligence that talks (C++ version)

This is an application that acts as an Artificial Intelligence.
As the user uses it more, the AI becomes more intelligent.

# Using it yourself

To use the AI:

- Download the source code
- Compile the source code
- Open the application
- That's it!

# Contributing

Below are a list of things that need improvement:

- All of the places where "quit" is used to exit to the main command line function needs to be changed to something else in order that the application itself doesn't quit.
- The conversation function currently has nothing in it
- The dictionary function needs more words. Or perhaps someone has made a c++ dictionary that we can use as a dependency
